### UAV Photogrammetry
  Stanley Harbour kelp identification: A short contract to undertake a drone survey of part of Stanley Harbour for the Falkland Islands Maritime Authority. Giant kelp was identified using a DJI Phantom 4 with a multispectral camera, the Red-Edge orthomosaic depicted here provides a stark contrast between vegetation and surrounding waters.

  Bone pile 3D models and fieldwork: As part of a National Geographic funded PhD project, a photogrammetry survey of bone piles on George and Barren Islands was undertaken. This involved the collection of sea lion mandibles and peat cores for age dating.

### Django WebApp
  A custom database, build with the Django Python framework and a PostgreSQL back-end, allows for data collection and storage relating to seabird by-catch rates from fishing vessels. This is part of on-going work for the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) for the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).

### Drive Times / Isochrones & Rurality Analysis
As part of the bid development team at SUEZ, one task was to understand the local authorities that the company was targeting. I introduced the practice of conducting drive time analysis from depots, including the percentage of households within each time band. From this it was possible to get a better understanding of the geography of the area. This led to improved resource and financial modelling, creating a successful bid for the largest residual and recycling contract in England. This practice then became standard at SUEZ for all future bids.

### Data Visualisation
I run a successful Etsy shop for fine art map prints. A PyQGIS script is used to clip raster elevation data by vector boundary files, before rendering through Blender to create a 3D visualisation of the data. Comissions for custom maps is quite a common occurrence, which has created the chance to experiment with different syles.
