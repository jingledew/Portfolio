## Projects:

### Earth Observation
  
  South Georgia glacial flour from LandSat7 ETM+ with Normalised Suspended Material Index (NMSI)
  
  Normalised Soil Moisture Index (NSMI) at Saladero Farm, Falkland Islands

### UAV Photogrammetry
  Stanley Harbour kelp identification: A short contract to undertake a drone survey of part of Stanley Harbour for the Falkland Islands Maritime Authority. Giant kelp was identified using a DJI Phantom 4 with a multispectral camera, the Red-Edge orthomosaic depicted here provides a stark contrast between vegetation and surrounding waters.

### Data Visualisation
Successfully run an Etsy shop for fine art map prints. A PyQGIS script is used to clip raster elevation data by vector boundary files, before rendering through Blender to create a 3D visualisation of the data. Comissions for custom maps is quite a common occurrence, which has created the chance to experiment with different syles.
